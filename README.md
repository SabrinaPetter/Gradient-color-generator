# Gradient-color-generator

Simple gradient color generator with real time updates

In the future I might update it so the color picker matches the color displayed so it is possible to visualize the RGB numbers and, as well, change the color slightly.

In this project my biggest challenge was to get js to update the text box to match the current color and in a hex number instead of rgb
